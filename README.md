## Premise
#### This project is a Sudoku Website with that uses a Sudoku API I created to solve puzzles and load new ones with varying difficulties ranging from "easy" to "very hard". The website integrates user authentication, followers, game count, and general activity management.

## How to get started?
<ol>
<li> Install MongoDB community edition
<li> Open the repository in a code editor like VSCode
<li> In your terminal (routed to your sudoku directory), run <b>`npm install`</b> to install the dependencies and get the node_modules folder.
<li> Run <b>`npm start`</b> to start your application
<li> Open a browser and visit "http://localhost:3000/". This is where your application will be hosted.
</ol>
